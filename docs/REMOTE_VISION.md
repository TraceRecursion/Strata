# The image encoder on another PC

Strata starts the image encoder as a separate process and speaks a small line protocol to it. That
process needs no GPU of its own and is not tied to the model server's machine, so it can run on a
second PC — which takes the encoder's VRAM off the card that runs the language model.

This is for the case the [troubleshooting table](DETAILS.md) describes as a choice between two
unsatisfying options:

| today | what it costs |
| --- | --- |
| `--vision gpu` | ~1.4 GB of VRAM, which comes out of the expert cache |
| `--vision cpu` | 3–30 s a picture, and all the CPU cores while it runs |

Remote vision is the third option: **the speed of a GPU encoder at no local VRAM.** Measured below.

## What it does

The wrapper (`tools/remote-vision/strata_vision_remote.py`) is a man in the middle. Strata starts it
where it would start `strata-vision`, and it forwards the protocol to an encoder on the other machine
over one ssh connection:

```
server --stdio--> wrapper ==(one multiplexed ssh)==> remote encoder
                    |                                     ^
                    +-- the picture, and the embeddings, cross as base64 over that same connection
```

The protocol passes **paths**, not data (`ENC <image> <out>`), and the server's temporary directory
only exists on this machine — so the wrapper sends the picture over and brings the embeddings back.
Two small things cross the network per picture: the image, and the embeddings (**10.0 MB** for 1024
image tokens at `n_embd` 2560, F32 — measured, the file is `tokens × 2560 × 4` bytes). The remote
encoder stays resident: the mmproj is loaded once, not per picture.

The remote side needs no Strata install:

```
<remote_root>/build/bin/strata-vision
<remote_root>/mmproj-*.gguf
<remote_root>/models/text-vocab-stub.gguf      metadata+vocabulary only; see make_vocab_stub.py
```

The stub is why the remote host does not need the 34–55 GB of text model: `strata-vision` opens the
text model with `mp.vocab_only = true` (`tools/vision/strata_vision.cpp`) and llama.cpp returns right
after the vocabulary, so no tensor data is ever read. `make_vocab_stub.py` builds that stub — 11 MB
instead of copying a 51 GB shard.

## Measured

Reference machine: Ryzen 7 9700X (8C/16T), 62.6 GB RAM, RTX 5080 16 GB. Vision host: i7-11800H,
RTX 3060 Laptop 12 GB, over a 10 GbE LAN. Model IQ3_S at a 524288-token context, `--kv int8`,
`--vram-reserve-mib 700`; the three configs differ **only** in the image encoder, and every run used a
**distinct** picture (the server caches embeddings by the image's hash).

One picture request, 1024×1024 (1088 prompt tokens), as the client sees it:

| encoder | median | first run | VRAM used | expert cache |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| this GPU | **1.63 s** | 2.46 s | 1383 MiB | 3112 experts, 5.96 GiB |
| **another PC** | **2.83 s** | 4.75 s | 0 | 3641 experts, 6.96 GiB |
| this CPU (8 threads) | **15.27 s** | 15.80 s | 0 | 3641 experts, 6.96 GiB |

So: **5.4× faster pictures than the CPU encoder, and 1.00 GiB more expert cache than the GPU one**
(+17% expert slots, straight from the engine's own startup line). It is 1.2 s slower per picture than
a local GPU encoder, which is the price of not spending the VRAM.

Isolated encoder timings agree: 0.182 s (RTX 5080), 1.53 s (remote, RTX 3060), 13.36 s (8 threads).
The whole-stack differences (+1.20 s, +13.64 s) match the isolated ones within 11%.

### What it does not do: make text faster

Moving the encoder off the card **does** grow the expert cache, and that is visible in the engine log
(3112 → 3641 experts). It does **not** show up as text speed. Long-context text, same config, three
modes:

| prompt | this GPU | another PC | this CPU |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 97 | 167.5 / 89.7 | 172.5 / 92.3 | 167.2 / 82.3 |
| 257,116 | 3268.5 / 79.3 | 3298.8 / 83.0 | 3306.5 / 87.1 |
| 462,743 | 3029.2 / 81.1 | 3051.6 / 81.0 | 3037.1 / 81.0 |

(prompt tok/s / decode tok/s.) The spread is within run-to-run noise. The reason is arithmetic: the
expert set is ~47 GiB, so 1 GiB more of it cached moves the coverage by ~2% and the hit rate barely.

**This is a picture-latency and VRAM trade, not a text-speed optimisation.** If the card has room
for the encoder, a local GPU encoder is faster than this one.

## Configuration

The config's `vision` section points `exe` at the wrapper and turns the FIFO exception on:

```json
"env": { "STRATA_VISION_SSH": "vision-host" },
"vision": {
  "exe": "tools/remote-vision/strata-vision-remote.cmd",
  "mmproj": ".../mmproj-Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-BF16.gguf",
  "model": ".../Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GSQ-RCO-IQ3_S-00001-of-00002.gguf",
  "gpu": true,
  "remote": true,
  "max_tokens": 1024
}
```

`STRATA_VISION_SSH` has **no default**: the encoder's host is the operator's, not this project's. It
is an ssh_config alias or `user@host`; `STRATA_VISION_ROOT` gives the directory on it (default
`~/Developer/strata-vision`). Both are read from the environment, and the server passes its own
environment to the encoder, so the config's `env` block is a convenient place for them.

| variable | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `STRATA_VISION_SSH` | **required** — the ssh target |
| `STRATA_VISION_ROOT` | the directory on it |
| `STRATA_VISION_SSH_OPTS` | extra ssh options |
| `STRATA_VISION_LIVENESS_PORT` | the port the remote watchdog probes back on this machine (default 1918) |
| `STRATA_VISION_PROBE_FAILS` | failures in a row before the encoder is reaped (default 3) |
| `STRATA_VISION_TIMEOUT` | one ENC reply (default: a fifth under the server's `STRATA_VISION_ENCODE_S`) |
| `STRATA_VISION_START_TIMEOUT` | the READY line (default: a fifth under `STRATA_VISION_READY_S`) |
| `STRATA_VISION_SSH_TIMEOUT` | one helper ssh |
| `STRATA_VISION_MUX` | ssh connection multiplexing. **Do not set this on Windows** — see below |

`strata-vision-remote.cmd` is the `exe` because the server starts it with
`subprocess.Popen(exe, stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE)`: a `.py` cannot be that process. The shim runs the
script with `.venv\Scripts\python.exe`, or whatever `STRATA_VISION_PYTHON` names. It was verified as
the server starts it — `Popen` can run a `.cmd`, and cmd.exe forwards the pipes untouched. Packing
the script into an `.exe` with PyInstaller also works and is not needed.

## Design notes

**The encoder must not hold the request FIFO.** A local encoder shares the GPU with the engine, so
upstream serialises encodes with the requests — an encode during a running request left that request
stuck at "reading the prompt" for good. A remote encoder shares nothing, and holding the FIFO across
the upload to a starved host froze the whole API, text requests included: one stalled encode left
every later request queued behind it. So with `"remote": true` the encode happens outside the queue.
The wrapper serialises its own encodes, and `encode_all` (#1072) is used either way.

**The server starts without the encoder.** A remote host can be off, asleep, or unreachable when the
server comes up. The server then serves text, and the first image asks for the encoder again
(`Service.ensure_vision`). Without this, a boot-order race would cost the whole server.

That retry has to fail as an **answerable request error**, not as an exception: anything that escapes
`prepare()` reaches socketserver, which logs a traceback and drops the connection, so the client is
told nothing at all. Measured before it was fixed: the client saw `status 0: An error occurred while
sending the request`. It now answers

```
400 {"error": {"type": "invalid_request_error",
               "message": "the image encoder is not available: the vision encoder did not start: ..."}}
```

in about 4 s, and the next image after the host returns succeeds on the same running server.

**The encoder is reaped when the server goes away.** The remote side runs under a watchdog that
TCP-probes the server's own port back over `$SSH_CONNECTION`: port open = the service is running;
closed for a few probes = reap the encoder. That covers a hard-killed server, a sleeping PC and a
dropped link, where no signal reaches the remote side at all. An earlier design — the wrapper
touching a heartbeat file over ssh every 20 s — died in production when one heartbeat ssh failed: the
watchdog reaped a healthy encoder while the server kept running.

**Windows: ssh multiplexing is not available.** `ControlMaster`/`ControlPath` fails with
`getsockname failed: Not a socket`, so it is off by default and `STRATA_VISION_MUX=1` is for hosts
where it works. That matters, because **one helper ssh costs 240–275 ms end to end** on Windows
(process, handshake, auth, close) and it is the whole of this wrapper's overhead:

| per picture | cost |
| --- | ---: |
| one helper ssh (`put`), one for the embeddings (`get`) | ~520 ms |
| the transfer itself (10 MB down, 200–380 KB up) | ~150 ms |
| base64 rather than raw bytes | 36 ms |

The per-image `ensure_scratch` that an earlier revision did was a third ssh and was removed: the
scratch directory is made in `preflight()` and re-made by `recover()`, and an encoder dying does not
remove it. That alone took a 1024-token picture from 1.81 s to 1.53 s. Folding the two remaining
helper ssh calls into one persistent file channel would save another ~500 ms; it is deliberately not
done here, because it adds a protocol and a state machine to the remote side for half a second.

**Residency on Windows.** The model server runs this machine close to its memory ceiling (a 47 GiB
model in RAM), and under that pressure Windows trims small background processes first. Measured in
production: a 5 MB `ssh.exe` helper authenticated, opened its session and then sat for 10 minutes
without delivering its exec request, and one encode took 1131 s while the vision host was idle and
healthy. So the wrapper asks for a working-set floor for itself and for every ssh it spawns
(`STRATA_VISION_RESIDENT_MIB`, `STRATA_VISION_HELPER_MIB`; `0` switches it off). It does not create
memory — it keeps ~100 MiB of already-resident pages from being trimmed, which was the difference
between a 2 s encode and a 19 minute one.

**Timeouts are derived from the server's.** The server waits `STRATA_VISION_ENCODE_S` /
`STRATA_VISION_READY_S` for these same two lines and kills the wrapper when its wait runs out, so the
wrapper's defaults are a fifth shorter: a slow host is then reported as an `ERR` line the server can
read, instead of looking like an encoder that died.

## Trying it

```sh
# on the vision host, once
cmake -S tools/vision -B build -DLLAMA_DIR=<llama.cpp> -DSTRATA_VISION_CUDA=ON && cmake --build build -j
# and place mmproj-*.gguf plus a text-vocab stub beside it (make_vocab_stub.py)
```

```powershell
# on the server machine
$env:STRATA_VISION_SSH = 'vision-host'
pwsh -File tools/remote-vision/test-wrapper.ps1
```

The server's side of it — start with the host down, text keeps working, the first image answers 400,
and the next image after the host comes back succeeds — was verified against a running server with a
`ProxyCommand` whose reachability is a flag file, so one server run sees the host go away and return.
`Service.ensure_vision`'s half of it is pinned by
`serve/test_server.py::RemoteVision`.

`tools/remote-vision/` also has `remote-build.sh` (builds the encoder on a Linux host),
`update-remote-vision.ps1` (copies the encoder and the files it needs) and
`remote-vision-watchdog.sh` (the reaper described above).
